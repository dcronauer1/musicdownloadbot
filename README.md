# Music Download Bot
This program allows you to download youtube videos/playlists as songs/albums, with metadata options, through Discord

# Features:
* Download music from YouTube as .opus.  
  * Download playlists as either separate or single file(s) using type = playlist or type = album, respectively
  * .m4a is partially supported.
* Add title, author, album title, tags, and more ~~(year, date)~~  
* Store a list of authors and tags. 
  * If names are very close, it will be stored as the same artist/tag.
    * Todo: add config to disable this
* Add Album/Song covers from musicbrainz database

# How To Setup:
This program has only been tested on ubuntu-server, but should work on any linux-based system with the apt package manager  
Download and run "installer.sh" from the newest release  
set up directories accordingly in config.json

## Environment Setup:
### On Phone:
* Get foobar2000 or musicolet
  * Both are supported
  * Foobar2000 will automatically split files with timestamps into separate songs
  * Musicolet needs a seperate txt file for timestamps (which is generated).  
    * ~~Need to enable timestamp file generation in config.~~ Also need to tell musicolet to use .LRC file. Will auto-apply for each song.
* Get FolderSync app. Set up with ssh keys to auto sync music to phone.
    * Unknown if there is an IOS alternative.

### On Client PC(s):
* Foobar2000 recommended  
* Will add sync script in the future

# Notes
* Soundcloud "works"; however, without a Soundcloud Go subscription, downloads are heavily compressed.
  * Resource for adding soundcloud go token: https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedl/wiki/howdoidownloadhighqualityaudiofromsoundcloud/
* Default cover size can be "250”, “500”, “1200”. Anything else will default to max size, which is often much larger than 1200, so is not recommended.
