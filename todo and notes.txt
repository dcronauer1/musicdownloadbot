[big things]
	Add other platforms
		grabbing links raw (with wget or smthing)
			this might work natively

[features]
2	add more arguments
		date, year
		add in a force: so if force is true then it uses inputted args exactly

	commands:
3		command to add/replace artists, tags, and title

	add ability to download playlists into albums
		combine playlists into one file and timestamp each video
		
1	When confirming download, have a loading gif or something

1	make an argument for download to default confirmations timeouts to true
		so itll still send confirmations, but when they timeout itll be true instead of false

2	for replacement commands, add functionality to replace for an entire *split* album.
		so if each track is a different file, either look in the sub dir (album/track.m4a), or look at the metadata for songs with that album name
	
3	ability to download youtube videos as well
		shouldnt be too hard, i can just ignore metadata and run the command raw
		need extra configs (for directory)

5	timestamps metadata from database
		get timestamps (titles, or titles and times) from database
		ability to replace only the timestamp titles (keep times the same)

4	implement usedatabase
		should do usedatabase cover,tracktimes,tracknames
			instead of true/false
		cover, timestamps, timestamp names
		for song, everything should be replaced
		for album_playlist, everything
		for playlist, just song names should be replaced

3	be able to cancel ⏳ Please send thumbnail (text or image attachment):

5	ability to exclude videos from playlists and album_playlist
		check yt-dlp docs


[bugs]
5	type=album_playlist should put playlist link in comments
5	type=playlist if a track does not have an album cover, it will find a generic cover
		should be able to set strict, and it should use album cover if track cover cant be found

[improvements]
2	bot message improvements
		make bot cleanup its confirmation boxes
	✓	add emojis for success/fail to make it more readable
		make more specific errors
			Timeout error
		react to timestamp message if it processes correctly
		polish messages
			some messages are client only, some get sent. this should be universal
		include some sort of id with EVERY message for multi downloading
			probably just use yt link
		let user know when its downloading
		Send timestamps text file as a codeblock instead of a file upload
3	apply_manual_timestamps_to_file
		make this bidirectional, so [title][time] could also be valid
		better errors, so invalid will actually get flagged
		could have error checking in ask_for_timestamps() instead
			if i do this, then add comment in apply_manual_timestamps_to_file() that it expects a specific format
1	make musicolet file optional in config.json
2	make json lists separated by new line

✓	set up defaults properly (default author is channel uploader, default title is video title, etc)
		need to do date still

	[bugs]
	✓	handle this error: (happens when providing a bad link)
			ERROR: [generic] 'a' is not a valid URL. Set --default-search "ytsearch" (or run  yt-dlp "ytsearch:a" ) to search YouTube
			Error: Failed to fetch video info.
			Stderr:
			ERROR: [generic] 'a' is not a valid URL. Set --default-search "ytsearch" (or run  yt-dlp "ytsearch:a" ) to search YouTube
			Artist 'Unknown' is new. Add it to the known list?


✓	add a confirm to add new artists if it doesnt exist, so seperate message
✓	maybe code to check if there are similar names?
✓	store artists in a list?
✓	handle moving the file to the proper directory

✓	argument to manually add timestamps, support same format as yt description: hr:min:sec "title"

every time yt-dlp is ran, run below:
✓	./yt-dlp -U # update

✓add tags
✓	store tags
✓timestamps
✓	need a way to parse yt description
✓	[min:sec.mili]{chaptername}
✓	[songname].txt
✓	add timestamps manually if not found
✓	need to have a confirmation too
✓	add a way to get timestamps

✓add descriptions to arguments
✓make file names all lowercase
✓make confirmations refer to the music file
✓check if song already exists

✓	[BUG] when adding custom timestamps, all other metadata is wiped

✓	if timestamps bool is false, it should skip asking. should default store as NONE
