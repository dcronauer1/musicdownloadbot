[big things]
	Add other platforms
		soundcloud
		grabbing links raw (with wget or smthing)

[features]
	add more arguments
		date, year

		add argument for song/playlist (default song)
			when playlist, it should have the option to put everything into a subfolder for that album
		argument to either split or timestamp
			check for timestamps, handle accordingly
			when splitting, it should have the option to put everything into a subfolder for that album

	commands:
✓		make a command to list artists
✓		command to list tags
		command to add artists or tags

	add ability to download playlists into albums
		combine playlists into one file and timestamp each video

	Custom thumbnail argument

	When confirming download, affirm user that it is downloading

	make an argument for download to default confirmations timeouts to true
		so itll still send confirmations, but when they timeout itll be true instead of false

		check this: https://github.com/TheQwertiest/foo_discord_rich
			https://theqwertiest.github.io/foo_discord_rich/

[bugs]
	handle this error: (happens when providing a bad link)
		ERROR: [generic] 'a' is not a valid URL. Set --default-search "ytsearch" (or run  yt-dlp "ytsearch:a" ) to search YouTube
		Error: Failed to fetch video info.
		Stderr:
		ERROR: [generic] 'a' is not a valid URL. Set --default-search "ytsearch" (or run  yt-dlp "ytsearch:a" ) to search YouTube

[improvements]
	bot message improvements
		make bot cleanup its confirmation boxes
	✓	add emojis for success/fail to make it more readable
		make more specific errors
			Timeout error
		react to timestamp message if it processes correctly
		polish messages
			some messages are client only, some get sent. this should be universal
		include some sort of id with EVERY message for multi downloading
			probably just use yt link
		let user know when its downloading
		Send timestamps text file as a codeblock instead of a file upload
	apply_manual_timestamps_to_file
		make this parse better (so mirrored is still valid)
			bidirectional, so [title][time] could also be valid
		better errors, so invalid will actually get flagged
		could have error checking in ask_for_timestamps() instead
			if i do this, then add comment in apply_manual_timestamps_to_file() that it expects a specific format
	make musicolet file optional in config.json

✓	set up defaults properly (default author is channel uploader, default title is video title, etc)
		need to do date still
