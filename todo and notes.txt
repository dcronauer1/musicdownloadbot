script reqs:


every time yt-dlp is ran, run below:
✓	./yt-dlp -U # update


seperate by artist (directory should be music/[songs, album, or album folder])
✓	so check if dir exists
✓		add a confirm to add new artists if it doesnt exist, so seperate message
✓	maybe code to check if there are similar names?
✓	store artists in a list?
✓	handle moving the file to the proper directory

✓	argument to manually add timestamps, support same format as yt description: hr:min:sec "title"
	add more arguments
		date, year
		maybe album?
		add in a force: so if force is true then it uses inputted args exactly
add ability to download playlists into albums
✓add tags
✓	store tags
✓timestamps
✓	need a way to parse yt description
✓	[min:sec.mili]{chaptername}
✓	[songname].txt
✓	add timestamps manually if not found
✓	need to have a confirmation too
✓	add a way to get timestamps
✓fix postprocessor-args, or use it correctly? idk
make bot cleanup its confirmation boxes
✓	add emojis for success/fail to make it more readable
commands:
	make a command to list artists
	command to list tags
	command to add artists or tags
	generate timestamps for an already downloaded song
✓add descriptions to arguments
✓make file names all lowercase
✓make confirmations refer to the music file
✓check if song already exists
make an argument for download to default confirmations timeouts to true
	so itll still send confirmations, but when they timeout itll be true instead of false
Custom thumbnail argument
Add other platforms

priority:
	make it so when timestamps flag is true, timestamps are asked for before downloading the video
✓	[BUG] when adding custom timestamps, all other metadata is wiped
		from mutagen.m4a import M4ATags
		https://chat.deepseek.com/a/chat/s/55c9d945-bdd9-403c-8766-e5c585b3b681
	if timestamps bool is false, it should skip asking. should default store as NONE

	arguments
		add argument for song/playlist (default song)
			when playlist, it should have the option to put everything into a subfolder for that album
		argument to either split or timestamp
			check for timestamps, handle accordingly
			when splitting, it should have the option to put everything into a subfolder for that album
		make sure to add an album argument

	[feat] combine playlists into one file and timestamp each video

	make a list of all youtube links used? maybe?
	make lists separated by new line
		dont forget about the replace timestamps list files on fail thing
	handle this error:
		ERROR: [generic] 'a' is not a valid URL. Set --default-search "ytsearch" (or run  yt-dlp "ytsearch:a" ) to search YouTube
		Error: Failed to fetch video info.
		Stderr:
		ERROR: [generic] 'a' is not a valid URL. Set --default-search "ytsearch" (or run  yt-dlp "ytsearch:a" ) to search YouTube
