[big things]
	Add other platforms
		soundcloud
		grabbing links raw (with wget or smthing)
	implement type=playlist

[features]
	add more arguments
		date, year
		add in a force: so if force is true then it uses inputted args exactly
✓		add argument for song/playlist (default song)
✓			when playlist, it should have the option to put everything into a subfolder for that album
		argument to either split or timestamp
			check for timestamps, handle accordingly
			when splitting, it should have the option to put everything into a subfolder for that album

	commands:
✓		make a command to list artists
✓		command to list tags
		command to add/replace artists or tags
✓		generate timestamps for an already downloaded song

	add ability to download playlists into albums
		combine playlists into one file and timestamp each video

	Custom thumbnail argument

	When confirming download, affirm user that it is downloading

	make an argument for download to default confirmations timeouts to true
		so itll still send confirmations, but when they timeout itll be true instead of false

✓	ability to replace cover/thumbnail
		add this to download command

	add this *maybe* (quality was pretty shit, seems better to just rip from youtube manually)
		sudo apt install npm #used for freyr-js
		    npm install -g freyr
		    https://github.com/miraclx/freyr-js
	for replacement commands, add functionality to replace for an entire *split* album.
		so if each track is a different file, either look in the sub dir (album/track.m4a), or look at the metadata for songs with that album name
	
	ability to download youtube videos as well
		shouldnt be too hard, i can just ignore metadata and run the command raw
		need extra configs (for directory)

✓	ability to pull details from a database
✓		including thumbnail

	be able to cancel ⏳ Please send thumbnail (text or image attachment):


	ability to replace only the timestamp titles (keep times the same)
	get timestamps (titles, or titles and times) from database

	for list music, list subdirectories as well (maybe run tree but exclude .txt files?)


[bugs]

	


[improvements]
	bot message improvements
		make bot cleanup its confirmation boxes
	✓	add emojis for success/fail to make it more readable
		make more specific errors
			Timeout error
		react to timestamp message if it processes correctly
		polish messages
			some messages are client only, some get sent. this should be universal
		include some sort of id with EVERY message for multi downloading
			probably just use yt link
		let user know when its downloading
		Send timestamps text file as a codeblock instead of a file upload
	apply_manual_timestamps_to_file
		make this parse better (so mirrored is still valid)
			bidirectional, so [title][time] could also be valid
		better errors, so invalid will actually get flagged
		could have error checking in ask_for_timestamps() instead
			if i do this, then add comment in apply_manual_timestamps_to_file() that it expects a specific format
	make musicolet file optional in config.json
	make json lists separated by new line

	from mutagen.m4a import M4ATags
		https://chat.deepseek.com/a/chat/s/55c9d945-bdd9-403c-8766-e5c585b3b681

	
✓	set up defaults properly (default author is channel uploader, default title is video title, etc)
		need to do date still

	[improvements]
	✓	find a way to make the starting portion of replace commands be in one spot for the class
	✓	make list dir line a function, and make it exclude .txt (multiple instances of it in main)
	✓		dont forget about the replace timestamps list files on fail thing

	[bugs]
	✓	handle this error: (happens when providing a bad link)
			ERROR: [generic] 'a' is not a valid URL. Set --default-search "ytsearch" (or run  yt-dlp "ytsearch:a" ) to search YouTube
			Error: Failed to fetch video info.
			Stderr:
			ERROR: [generic] 'a' is not a valid URL. Set --default-search "ytsearch" (or run  yt-dlp "ytsearch:a" ) to search YouTube
			Artist 'Unknown' is new. Add it to the known list?


✓	add a confirm to add new artists if it doesnt exist, so seperate message
✓	maybe code to check if there are similar names?
✓	store artists in a list?
✓	handle moving the file to the proper directory

✓	argument to manually add timestamps, support same format as yt description: hr:min:sec "title"

every time yt-dlp is ran, run below:
✓	./yt-dlp -U # update

✓add tags
✓	store tags
✓timestamps
✓	need a way to parse yt description
✓	[min:sec.mili]{chaptername}
✓	[songname].txt
✓	add timestamps manually if not found
✓	need to have a confirmation too
✓	add a way to get timestamps

✓add descriptions to arguments
✓make file names all lowercase
✓make confirmations refer to the music file
✓check if song already exists

✓	[BUG] when adding custom timestamps, all other metadata is wiped

✓	if timestamps bool is false, it should skip asking. should default store as NONE
